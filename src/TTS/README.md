# Text To Speech 

Stuff in this directory is meant for (as the heading implies) Text to Speech. Put the actual model (with the extension: .pth.tar) along with its config.json in the model folder.
 
Jupyter notebooks regarding training and other utilites have been placed in the model folder as well, within a subdirectory.

If you need any help, have any suggestion, or anything you want to say to me, create a Github issue and I'll look into it. (Same goes for other branches as well)

Here is the directory tree

```
.
├── model
├── README.md
└── TTS.py

1 directory, 2 files
```
(tree created with 'tree' util available in linux)
